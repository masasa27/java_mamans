Hi!
shabbat shalom :)

ex1 -> run main.java
----------------------------------------------------------------
i wasn't sure if to read employees from a file or not, but im guessing this will do 
ive added a concrete implementation of employee to add +200 shekels behavior to all employee
child classes

the rest as described
----------------------------------------------------------------

ex2 -> run GameOfLife.java
--------------------------------
if you wish to have a larger sacle from 10*10, change X_BOUND and Y_BOUND 
respectively, in GameOfLifeController.java.
--------------------------------

i didnt move the game into a different class since its still all realated
on a larger scale game i would have

thanks!
